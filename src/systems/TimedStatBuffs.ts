/**
 * Pure logic for temporary, timed multiplicative buffs on a named PlayerStats
 * multiplier field — e.g. Power Surge's "2× damage for 8s", Elite Surge's
 * "2× XP for 10s", Golden Tide's "3× gem value for 10s".
 *
 * Each buff records the stat it scales, the multiplier it applied, and the
 * absolute run `gameTime` at which it should revert. Because expiry is keyed to
 * the run's serialized `gameTime` clock — not a Phaser `delayedCall` that dies
 * on page reload — these buffs survive refresh-recovery: the save stores the
 * buff list verbatim and `gameTime` is restored to the same value, so each buff
 * reverts at exactly the moment it would have without the reload.
 *
 * This generalises the original damage-only list (see BUG-EVENT-BUFF-REVERT):
 * Elite Surge (XP) and Golden Tide (gem value) used a `delayedCall` revert that
 * dies on reload while the save baked the already-multiplied stat, leaving the
 * boon permanent on a mid-event refresh — the same class of bug the power-shrine
 * (`eb16e16`) and Power Surge (`d7ab577`) fixes already closed for damage.
